## Test Execution

### Running Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Backend unit tests
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/test_firebase_core.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_auth_firebase.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_user_profile_service.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_migration_verification.py -v

# Backend integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_firebase_auth_integration.py -v -m integration

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
flutter test test/repositories/firebase_auth_repository_test.dart
flutter test test/widgets/firebase_login_screen_test.dart

## Mock Strategy

### Backend Mocking Approach
- Firebase Admin SDK functions are mocked to avoid external dependencies
- Realistic token payloads and error scenarios are simulated
- Firestore operations are mocked for isolated unit testing
- Integration tests use controlled mock environments

### Frontend Mocking Approach
- Firebase Auth SDK is mocked using mocktail
- Google Sign-In services are mocked for predictable testing
- Network requests are mocked to test API integration
- Widget testing uses Flutter's built-in testing framework

## CI/CD Integration

### Test Environment Requirements
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies
- Flutter SDK with Firebase dependencies
- Environment variables for test configuration
- Mock Firebase credentials for testing

### Environment Variables for Testing

## Known Limitations and Considerations

### Test Environment Limitations
- Firebase emulator integration not included (uses mocks instead)
- Real Firebase project testing requires manual setup
- Network latency and real-world conditions not simulated
- Firebase quota and rate limiting not tested

### Migration-Specific Testing
- Legacy to Firebase user mapping requires manual verification
- Existing item ownership continuity needs production validation
- Performance impact of Firebase calls requires load testing
- Firebase billing and quota implications need monitoring

## Maintenance and Updates

### Test Maintenance Schedule
- **Weekly**: Run full test suite and verify all tests pass
- **Monthly**: Review test coverage and add tests for new scenarios
- **Quarterly**: Update mock data to reflect real Firebase behavior
- **Per Release**: Validate tests against latest Firebase SDK versions

### Test Data Management
- Mock tokens should be updated periodically
- Test user profiles should reflect realistic data patterns
- Error scenarios should be updated based on Firebase changes
- Performance benchmarks should be established and monitored

## Troubleshooting Common Test Issues

### Backend Test Failures
1. **Firebase initialization errors**: Check environment variables and credentials
2. **Mock assertion failures**: Verify mock setup matches expected Firebase behavior
3. **Integration test timeouts**: Ensure test environment has adequate resources
4. **Import errors**: Verify all required Python packages are installed

### Frontend Test Failures
1. **Widget test failures**: Ensure Flutter SDK version compatibility
2. **Mock setup issues**: Verify mocktail package is properly configured
3. **Async test failures**: Check for proper async/await usage in tests
4. **Dependency resolution**: Run `flutter pub get` before testing

### Performance Considerations
- Backend tests should complete in <30 seconds
- Frontend tests should complete in <60 seconds
- Integration tests may take up to 2 minutes
- Full test suite should complete in <5 minutes

## Success Criteria

The Firebase migration is considered test-ready when:

✅ **All unit tests pass**: Every Firebase module has comprehensive test coverage

✅ **Performance validated**: Authentication flows meet performance requirements
✅ **Security verified**: Token handling and user isolation are properly tested
✅ **Migration verified**: Legacy data access is preserved after migration
✅ **Documentation complete**: All test procedures and requirements are documented

## Next Steps After Test Validation

2. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual verification with real Firebase project
3. **Performance Testing**: Validate authentication performance under load
4. **Security Review**: Conduct security audit of Firebase integration
5. **Documentation Update**: Update API docs and developer guides
6. **Production Migration**: Plan and execute production deployment
7. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement Firebase authentication monitoring
8. **Post-Migration Validation**: Verify system health after production deployment
