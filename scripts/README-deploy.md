# Interactive Deployment Script

Quick deployment tool for Pottery App across all environments.

## Quick Start

```bash
# From project root
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Or from scripts directory
cd scripts
./deploy.sh
```

## Current Features (Local/Docker Only)

### Deployment Options

1. **Backend Only** - Deploys local Docker backend
   - Starts Docker container with backend API
   - Accessible at `http://{YOUR_IP}:8000`
   - API docs at `http://{YOUR_IP}:8000/api/docs`

2. **Frontend Only** - Builds and deploys Flutter app
   - Auto-detects USB-connected Android device
   - Installs debug build to device if connected
   - Always builds AAB for Play Store upload
   - Configures app to connect to local Docker backend

3. **Both** - Full stack deployment
   - Deploys backend Docker container
   - Builds and installs frontend to USB device
   - Builds AAB for Play Store

### Features

✅ **Auto-detect USB device** - Finds connected Android phones via adb
✅ **Auto-build AAB** - Always creates app bundle for Play Store
✅ **Smart IP detection** - Automatically finds your local network IP
✅ **Post-deployment instructions** - Shows next steps after completion
✅ **Color-coded output** - Easy to read progress and status

### What Gets Built

**Backend:**
- Docker container: `pottery-backend-local`
- Port: 8000
- Environment: local

**Frontend:**
- Flavor: local
- App Name: "Pottery Studio Local"
- Package: com.pottery.app.local
- Backend URL: `http://{YOUR_LOCAL_IP}:8000`
- Outputs:
  - Debug APK (if USB device connected)
  - AAB: `frontend/build/app/outputs/bundle/localRelease/app-local-release.aab`

## Requirements

### Backend Deployment
- Docker installed and running
- Port 8000 available

### Frontend Deployment
- Flutter SDK installed
- Android SDK installed (for adb)
- USB device connected (optional, for device installation)
- Backend running (for testing)

## Post-Deployment

After successful deployment, the script shows:

1. **Backend info** - URL, API docs, health check endpoint
2. **Frontend info** - Installed app details, USB device name
3. **AAB location** - Where to find app bundle for Play Store upload
4. **Testing instructions** - How to verify deployment
5. **Documentation links** - Where to find more info

## Coming Soon

🚧 **Dev Environment Support**
- Deploy to Google Cloud Run (dev)
- Build with dev backend URL
- gcloud authentication check

🚧 **Prod Environment Support**
- Deploy to Google Cloud Run (prod)
- IAM role verification
- Production safety checks

🚧 **Enhanced Features**
- Custom app naming for sideloaded apps ("SL" suffix)
- Automatic version bumping
- Deployment history tracking

## Examples

### Backend Only
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
# Choose: 1 (Backend Only)
# Result: Docker container running on port 8000
```

### Frontend with USB Device
```bash
# Connect Android device via USB
./scripts/deploy.sh
# Choose: 2 (Frontend Only)
# Result: App installed on device + AAB built
```

### Full Stack
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
# Choose: 3 (Both)
# Result: Backend running + App on device + AAB built
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No USB device detected"
- Connect Android device via USB
- Enable USB debugging on device
- Run `adb devices` to verify connection
- Try `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

### "Port 8000 already in use"
- Stop existing backend: `docker stop pottery-backend-local`
- Or kill process: `lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill`

### "Docker not found"
- Install Docker Desktop
- Start Docker daemon
- Verify with `docker ps`

### "Flutter not found"
- Install Flutter SDK
- Add to PATH
- Verify with `flutter doctor`
