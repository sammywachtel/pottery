# Interactive Deployment Script

Quick deployment tool for Pottery App across all environments.

## Quick Start

```bash
# From project root
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Or from scripts directory
cd scripts
./deploy.sh
```

## Current Features (Local/Docker Only)

### Deployment Options

1. **Backend Only** - Deploys local Docker backend
   - Starts Docker container with backend API
   - Accessible at `http://{YOUR_IP}:8000`
   - API docs at `http://{YOUR_IP}:8000/api/docs`

2. **Frontend Only** - Builds and deploys Flutter app
   - Auto-detects USB-connected Android device
   - Installs debug build to device if connected
   - Always builds AAB for Play Store upload
   - Configures app to connect to local Docker backend

3. **Both** - Full stack deployment
   - Deploys backend Docker container
   - Builds and installs frontend to USB device
   - Builds AAB for Play Store

### Features

âœ… **Auto-detect USB device** - Finds connected Android phones via adb
âœ… **Auto-build AAB** - Always creates app bundle for Play Store
âœ… **Smart IP detection** - Automatically finds your local network IP
âœ… **Post-deployment instructions** - Shows next steps after completion
âœ… **Color-coded output** - Easy to read progress and status

### What Gets Built

**Backend:**
- Docker container: `pottery-backend-local`
- Port: 8000
- Environment: local

**Frontend:**
- Flavor: local
- App Name: "Pottery Studio Local"
- Package: com.pottery.app.local
- Backend URL: `http://{YOUR_LOCAL_IP}:8000`
- Outputs:
  - Debug APK (if USB device connected)
  - AAB: `frontend/build/app/outputs/bundle/localRelease/app-local-release.aab`

## Requirements

### Backend Deployment
- Docker installed and running
- Port 8000 available

### Frontend Deployment
- Flutter SDK installed
- Android SDK installed (for adb)
- USB device with USB debugging enabled (optional, for device installation)
  - **First time:** Device will prompt "Allow USB debugging?" - tap Allow
  - **After authorization:** Connection is automatic when plugged in
- Backend running (for testing)

## Post-Deployment

After successful deployment, the script shows:

1. **Backend info** - URL, API docs, health check endpoint
2. **Frontend info** - Installed app details, USB device name
3. **AAB location** - Where to find app bundle for Play Store upload
4. **Testing instructions** - How to verify deployment
5. **Documentation links** - Where to find more info

## Coming Soon

ðŸš§ **Dev Environment Support**
- Deploy to Google Cloud Run (dev)
- Build with dev backend URL
- gcloud authentication check

ðŸš§ **Prod Environment Support**
- Deploy to Google Cloud Run (prod)
- IAM role verification
- Production safety checks

ðŸš§ **Enhanced Features**
- Custom app naming for sideloaded apps ("SL" suffix)
- Automatic version bumping
- Deployment history tracking

## Examples

### Backend Only
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
# Choose: 1 (Backend Only)
# Result: Docker container running on port 8000
```

### Frontend with USB Device
```bash
# Connect Android device via USB
./scripts/deploy.sh
# Choose: 2 (Frontend Only)
# Result: App installed on device + AAB built
```

### Full Stack
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
# Choose: 3 (Both)
# Result: Backend running + App on device + AAB built
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No USB device detected" or "Device unauthorized"
**First-time setup:**
1. Enable USB debugging on device:
   - Settings â†’ About Phone â†’ Tap "Build Number" 7 times
   - Settings â†’ Developer Options â†’ Enable "USB Debugging"
2. Connect device via USB
3. Tap "Allow" on device when prompted "Allow USB debugging?"
4. Connection will be automatic on subsequent plugs

**If previously authorized:**
- Disconnect and reconnect USB cable
- Run `adb devices` to verify connection shows "device" (not "unauthorized")
- Try `adb kill-server && adb start-server`

**Script behavior:**
- Detects unauthorized devices and waits 10 seconds for authorization
- Shows helpful prompts to tap "Allow" on device
- Automatically retries after authorization

### "Port 8000 already in use"
- Stop existing backend: `docker stop pottery-backend-local`
- Or kill process: `lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill`

### "Docker not found"
- Install Docker Desktop
- Start Docker daemon
- Verify with `docker ps`

### "Flutter not found"
- Install Flutter SDK
- Add to PATH
- Verify with `flutter doctor`
